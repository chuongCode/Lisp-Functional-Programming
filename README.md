# Lisp-Functional-Programming
A project based on Alan Turing’s formalization of “computable functions” using Turing machines. This project is meant to be an introduction to the original functional programming language: Lisp. It contains a handful of simple functions built with Lisp's syntax.

Just to note: Power function does not handle negative values:

Ex. pow 2 -2 produces an error.
